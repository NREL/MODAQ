# MODAQ

This repo contains the LabVIEW source code for the <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/water/annual-report-2022/" target="_blank">Waterpower Group</a> at NREL's MODAQ Reference Design data acquisition and control system. 

The Reference Design serves as an introduction to MODAQ and to publicly share some of the core logic and functionality of the MODAQ codebase. This code is fully functional and can acquire data from an inertial navigation system and/or GPS and 3-phase voltage and current from PT/CTs. NREL has built elaborate, distributed, and high channel count systems with supervisory control and automation from this same basic codebase architecture. 

We encourage users to provide feedback through the Issues or Discussions tab in this repo or directly through water.power (at) nrel.gov. 

There are also mechanisms for us to assist or partner in your projects.
